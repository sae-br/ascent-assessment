1	CC	HIGH	#### Watch for artificial harmony. \r\nWhen executives always agree with the CEO (or each other), it indicates they’re trying to survive in an environment where all the signals imply that opposition is bad and agreement is good. A ‘yes person’ culture surrounds us with like-minded individuals—on the leadership team, the new people we hire, and even the consultants we work with—and then rewards them for their consistent agreement with us. Under the guise of “cultural fit”, it seems totally logical, but what’s often really happening is the culture is being decided at the top and the loss of collective intelligence, creativity, and capacity to evolve undermines our leadership performance and organizational results.\r\n\r\n#### Get real feedback about trust levels. \r\nTalk to managers and team members who you know will be straight with you about their observations around trust and fear. Ask questions like: \r\n“Are we encouraging people to innovate or does it feel like they have to conform?” \r\n“Are differing perspectives and opinions tolerated?” \r\n“What happens when mistakes occur? How does leadership respond?” \r\n\r\n#### Focus on collaborative wins.\r\nBy consistently focusing on others instead of ourselves, we exercise underused core competencies of leadership like self-awareness, active listening, and empathy. When an organization’s most senior leaders model these behaviours, it’s much more likely to cascade through all levels and become a natural behaviour in our company culture.\r\n\r\n#### Build real connections with your people. \r\nWhile there should be no expectation to form deep friendships with colleagues, most executives should push themselves to cultivate more curiosity and prioritize relational connection. You'll need a deeper level of investment and commitment to create the strong bonds that will ultimately lead your team to remarkable results.\r\n\r\nNotice that none of these next steps are “host a day-away fun event”! Grand gestures usually worsen the situation when the real work isn’t being done by the leadership team to improve the things that are less than healthy. We recommend starting with the hard work and using events to cement the work already being done to build a healthy culture of collaboration, rather than relying on them as substitutes.

4	LA	HIGH	#### Share your own process of growth, discovery, and challenge. \r\nThe static leader inspires no long-term loyalty. People need to see you growing to be confident in continuing to trust you to lead them. No leader has “arrived”, but people are not looking for those who are perfect, just for those who are competent, honest, and truly improving in the areas that matter.\r\n\r\n#### Embrace vulnerability as a strength. \r\nPeople need permission to make mistakes… and the accountability to learn from them. If we want innovation and creativity from our teams, it’s imperative that our people are willing to take risks. But this must be modelled by the leaders.

Often early warning signs of issues get ignored or excused or not passed to the right people because no one wants to be the bearer of bad news or to be perceived as simply negative. Reframing how your company reacts to negative information is part of keeping the lines clear for both crisis prevention and continual improvement.

1	CC	HIGH	- Frustrations are less likely to build up over time, as there is a greater chance of team members airing their concerns and solutions being reached.\r\n- Crises are much more likely to be avoided because early warning signs are taken more seriously.\r\n- Budget and timelines are much more easily managed as all departments are aware of the status of various initiatives and quicker help each other for the good of the company as a whole.\r\n- People like working here. There is less risk of losing employees who are a great fit over frustrations or disillusionment.\r\n- People believe in your company; they will work more effectively and interact more favourably with customers, clients, and talented candidates in their network.
2	CC	MEDIUM	- Your team may need to examine the levels of trust shared. There may be dynamics at play that are currently being dismissed but are affecting the momentum and collaboration of the leadership team. These dynamics almost always cascade down unintentionally throughout the organization.\r\n- The level of commitment and satisfaction among the leadership team and workforce seems relatively positive. \r\n- While Collaborative Culture may not appear to be the most pressing area of concern, it is the centre of all organizational health, so every other area is either compromised or elevated by it. Consider how raising Collaborative Culture is affecting your lowest area and your highest area to gain more insight.
3	CC	LOW	- A low Collaborative Culture compromises all other areas of organizational health.\r\n- Likely, everyone’s energy, focus, and willingness to offer of their own resources is significantly lower than it should be, throughout the company.\r\n- An “it’s just a job” mentality results in high-performing staff being more likely to be poached.\r\n- Progress towards goals is slowed when the unexpected happens, and certain departments are over-extended due to lower flexibility and silos.\r\n- Important information does not get passed on consistently to those who need it.
4	LA	HIGH	- Your leadership team is likely able to communicate through crises and difficult decisions with less fallout than average.\r\n- Your leadership team members likely have a level of trust with each other that allows for greater candour and better decisions to be reached.\r\n- Your managers and workforce likely speak up about obstacles and issues more readily, knowing the leadership team will listen and take action as needed. This lowers the chances of important issues getting overlooked and frustrated high performers leaving.
5	LA	MEDIUM	- Your leadership team’s relationships with each other may include tensions.\r\n- Some leaders may be invested in personal growth while others may be stagnating in areas that are affecting the organization. \r\n- A middling score here often indicates that false harmony should be examined. Avoiding conflict means avoiding necessary improvement; this can look different from team to team but almost always has its roots in certain leaders not receiving feedback on their blind spots and not addressing them.
6	LA	LOW	- Inter-team relationships may be strained and either erupt “suddenly” in strong division or emerge slowly in false harmony, bullies taking over, alliances being formed, and politics compromising the entire organization’s effectiveness.\r\n- There is a higher risk of turnover in high performing managers and workforce due to frustrations with company leadership.\r\n- Lack of responsiveness to issues or ideas raised to the leadership team cascades down and silences all levels of the organization.\r\n- Decisions made at the top are made without accurate information about the departments that will be working towards the goals and upholding new processes, decreasing chances of successful implementation with the desired results.
7	SM	HIGH	- Your leadership team and whole organization experiences fewer wasted work hours, and quicker progress towards goals due to clarity and higher energy.\r\n- Job satisfaction is keeping pace with revenue growth.\r\n- The leadership team seems to be able to resolve issues quickly due to a clear and shared understanding of exactly what the key priorities and strategic anchors mean.\r\n- You are more likely to adopt necessary changes efficiently.
8	SM	MEDIUM	- If more focus was given towards clearly communicating key priorities and strategic anchors, and celebrating the achievement of goals in meaningful ways, the pace of progress would improve.\r\n- The clarity you have at the top may not be as clear as those executing the vision actually require.\r\n- Consider how owning your leadership and increasing collaboration could affect your progress and how much energy is required to maintain it.
9	SM	LOW	- Goals feel either too difficult or too easily achieved, resulting in lower energy being used towards achieving them.\r\n- Goal progress is slower than it should be, and at times is difficult to measure due to lack of clarity.\r\n- Rallying energy towards initiatives requires large gestures due to a low sense of momentum and clarity.
10	TM	HIGH	- Your hiring process likely goes more quickly than your competitors, with a greater chance of “right-first-time” hires.\r\n- Your company is less likely to have to over-pay good people to join.\r\n- Something about your company is drawing people to want to work there right now. (It is important to get clear about what that “something” is. This may represent growth in the other areas, or it may be due to a factor that cannot be predictably relied upon in the future such as a recognizable figurehead or a very positive reputation with the public.)
11	TM	MEDIUM	- Attracting and retaining proven and talented executives and workforce may be costing you more time and money than it should.\r\n- Talent Magnetism always rises when the other three areas are thriving, and conversely it cannot be maintained for the long run without the other three areas being done well.
12	TM	LOW	- Your company is more likely to have to over-pay good people to join or stay.\r\n- There’s a higher chance of disillusioned executives leaving, triggering significant costs for search and assimilation.\r\n- When Talent Magnetism is low and remains low, it almost always indicates that the other three areas are not as high as they need to be (and this may reveal you have a blind spot in those other three areas).

1	CC	LA	These results often occur in leadership teams that are either composed of people who are naturally attentive to the needs, wants, and experiences of other people around them (in MBTI terms, likely there is a strong preference for F) or have simply been putting in the work to develop a better experience of listening, collaborating, and creating psychological safety. This is a rare combination due to the typical selection that happens in the business world. \r\n\r\nThe positives of your team’s leadership are likely felt throughout the organization—people are quicker to speak up about concerns or warning signs, there is high loyalty within the workforce, and crises are more likely to be avoided because communication is very intentional and open.\r\n\r\nThe downside of this combination deserve attention, however. Sometimes these results indicate silos within the leadership team (tiny alliances rather than one unified team), false harmony, and issues between the leadership team and the other tiers of the organization. A healthy culture demands continual engagement in listening, conflict, personal ownership, and responsive action. Without these, the gap between the leadership team and the organization will continue to widen, and the cracks within the leadership team will result in seemingly sudden departures, accusations, and loss of stability.
2	CC	SM	Clear and open communication is key to preventing crises, and this is likely a high value on your leadership team. Employees also like working here—they believe in the company and are willing to put in extra effort to make it successful. This positive attitude towards success leads to better interactions with customers, clients, and talented candidates. However, the dissonance between your Collaborative Culture score and your Strategic Momentum score indicates that there continue to be important questions are not being asked/answered, roadblocks are not being addressed, innovation is not flourishing, and follow-through may be dropping off.\r\n\r\nThe highest risks for your organisation currently lie in the way your organization is being driven forward. The goals and desired future being set may be unclear, too difficult to achieve, or too easy to achieve, leading to a loss of momentum and energy in the actual progress towards goals. This loss can be difficult to measure, but a good indicator is when larger and larger gestures are required in order to get progress and momentum moving again. Until the core of this is addressed, your organization will continue to bleed time and money and lose its place among competitors due to not being able to keep pace.
3	CC	TM	Since Talent Magnetism is a natural result of the other three areas all being done well, a low result should turn your heads to re-examine the other areas. Since Collaborative Culture is rated highest for your team, there may be room for improvement there but the other two may provide more exact insights. \r\n\r\nWhile you proceed through the rest of this report, pay special attention to Leadership Accountability and Strategic Momentum, and push for true candour from each other. Not being able to attract or retain contributors that seem to be a good fit for your organization is a sign your leadership team is not seeing something important. When examining exit interviews, excuses can be made for each individual without ever addressing the common patterns and underlying issues, but this is the information you most need. The significant costs of hiring and assimilation being reduced will be a key measurable for your progress in identifying and improving the aspects of your organization that are currently lacking.
4	LA	CC	"Your leadership team likely places a high priority on its growth and improvement. This combination is a very interesting one, as the low Collaborative Culture score should actually cause re-examination of Leadership Accountability. Because this assessment has only gathered responses from the leadership team itself, there is always risk of our own perceptions being reported as fact. However, this tool is built so those inconsistencies will still rise to the surface and inform us. \r\n\r\nThese results often occur when the leadership team has invested heavily in some growth areas, but has not been able to break through into building a truly safe, candid, trustworthy culture which allows for the most important feedback, warning signs, and solutions to be brought up and acted upon. In fact, you may be “checking all the boxes” of Leadership Accountability from your own viewpoint, but still be unaware of or not addressing blindspots that are affecting the organization at large. Sometimes it also indicates a failure to cascade culture down through the various levels of the organization. This lack may already be producing silos, alliances, and unhealthy competition within the organization, slowing down crisis prevention and response time, increasing risk of talent poaching, and lowering overall commitment to the company."
5	LA	SM	Your team has likely invested highly in leadership development (as a group or as individuals). The perception your leadership team has is that you are receiving necessary feedback and have the respect of your company. These efforts are worth celebrating! Also, in order to grow further, your team will need to accept that the results of this assessment indicate there is a gap between your perceived reality and what is really going on within your team and company.\r\n\r\nThe most notable dissonance indicated by your results lies between the direction the leadership team is setting and the speed at which the company as a whole is achieving it. While this can be influenced by not having the right people in the other levels of the company, the hard reality is that the biggest “fix” for this issue is almost always within the leadership team’s power, not elsewhere. Goals are not clear, not compelling, or too unachievable. Unexpected situations are met with confusion and changes are not made quickly or clearly enough. More effort is being spent on motivating people towards goals than on progress actually being made. These issues all stem from the leadership team! Pay particular attention to how your team is affecting the clarity and momentum of your organization as you proceed through the rest of this report.
6	LA	TM	Since Talent Magnetism is a natural result of the other three areas all being done well, a low result should turn your heads to re-examine the other areas. With Leadership Accountability ranking as your highest cumulative rating, it is likely that your team places a high priority on leadership excellence and growth. However, this is also one of the areas where the C-suite is the least reliable in terms of self-assessment. \r\n\r\nAs you proceed through this report, consider carefully if you have truly created effective feedback loops and trust among your peers to receive insight into your blind spots. Consider whether the clarity your team has is really clear enough, and if it is being effectively cascaded throughout the organization. Having high performers leave the company or lacking a competent and committed workforce are problems that can’t (and shouldn’t) be fixed by money. As you begin to identify your own responsibilities for this lack and act on it, one measurable by which you can assess progress is already set: Talent Magnetism will rise.
10	TM	CC	Something about your organization is both compelling talent to sign on and keeping your current people from wanting to look elsewhere. If you don’t currently know what that is, it’s valuable to identify! This is a powerful help to your organization currently, but your future success will rely on the full picture of organizational health being reached. Talent Magnetism will always eventually fall if the other three areas are not also strong.  \r\n\r\nYour results indicate a high potential for siloed departments, lack of trust, politics, and unhealthy competition despite the “glow” of Talent Magnetism. You may have excellent people at the table, but the current dynamics keep your company from benefitting in the ways it should. As you work through this report, pay special attention to how your discussions with your leadership team peers unfolds. Are you/your team members being transparent and honest and even vulnerable, or are there barriers and blind spots that become apparent? Is there a tendency to dismiss or excuse suggestions made in this report or is the feedback being mindfully considered? Your leadership team is likely strong in many ways, but to create a resilient company that will maintain success, there are mindsets and leadership styles at your table that likely need to be transformed.

You may have excellent people at the table, but the current dynamics keep your company from benefitting in the ways it should. As you discuss the rest of this report together, challenge yourself to engage with your peers openly, without jumping to conclusions, and prepare yourself to take on the feedback that arises. These will likely be elements you have previously excused or dismissed or blamed on specific factors; resist the urge to do so in this discussion, as some of the keys to creating a stronger organization likely lie exactly there.
12	TM	SM	Something about your organization is both compelling talent to sign on and keeping your current people from wanting to look elsewhere. Perhaps your organization is making great strides in the People department, or your leadership team has invested heavily in personal growth and development. Perhaps the vision being cast is incredibly compelling, or you have recognizable people on your leadership team. However, the results indicate that there is a breakdown between the attractiveness of your organization and actual goals being identifiably achieved. Often, this breakdown is a clarity issue, but there are likely factors within Leadership Accountability and Collaborative Culture that also need to be addressed.\r\n\r\nThe wave you are currently riding will not last forever. To retain or improve your position in the marketplace, your company needs clear direction. Goals should be re-examined, and communication streams should be cleared. But this is not simply an issue with other levels of the organization: as the leadership team, there are pieces that will be illuminated in this report that are not about others—it’s about you. Building real momentum will end up freeing you to lead and focus far more effectively, but building this momentum will take intentional investment. This report will help you identify how to do exactly that.
7	SM	CC	Your results indicate what at first might seem like a contradiction: your company is somehow managing to move forward and accomplish its goals well, but is failing to work together effectively. While your progress in achieving your goals is commendable, there is a high possibility that your success is currently riding on the ambition, competitiveness, and decisiveness of your workforce, while building up costs of talent loyalty, workforce burnout, siloed departments, and false harmony.\r\n\r\nThis is a fairly common combination in companies that experience a level of success, as it is in keeping with traditional workplace values. However, as the workforce culture continues to further embrace new values, the costs of this approach will threaten your success more and more. As you work through this report, pay special attention to how your discussions with your leadership team peers unfolds. Are you/your team members being transparent and honest and even vulnerable, or are there barriers and blind spots that become apparent? Is there a tendency to dismiss or excuse suggestions made in this report or is the feedback being mindfully considered? Your leadership team is likely strong in many ways, but to create a resilient company that will maintain success, there are mindsets and leadership styles at your table that likely need to be transformed.
9	SM	TM	Since Talent Magnetism is a natural result of the other three areas all being done well, a low result should turn your heads to re-examine the other areas. The current reality for your leadership team may be that the machine of operations is running well—goals are being achieved—but you are likely bleeding time and money into managing workforce loyalty, burnout, and motivation. For reasons you may have not yet identified, you have noticeable issues with talent retention and attraction.\r\n\r\nA compelling and thriving culture requires far more than clear goals. The way the leadership team owns and models commitment, listening, growth, and collaboration (or fails to do so) can accelerate or impede the company’s overall success immensely. The root of these issues will almost always lie in Collaborative Culture and Leadership Accountability, so pay close attention as you continue through this report as a team.
8	SM	LA	While progress towards goals is continuing with success, your results show that the area of immediate concern is the communication, trust, and perceived behaviour of those in your leadership team—perhaps both internally and facing the organization. Relationships may already be strained and either erupt “suddenly” in strong division or emerge slowly in false harmony, bullies taking over, alliances being formed, and politics compromising the entire organization’s effectiveness.\r\n \r\nUsing the momentum you currently still have in terms of operational progress, now is the right time to focus energy towards the areas that are threatening the future stability of your organization. As you discuss the rest of this report together, challenge yourself to engage with your peers openly, without jumping to conclusions, and prepare yourself to take on the feedback that arises. The higher in a company you go, the harder it is to receive real insight into your own most important growth areas. However, the ceiling that your leadership team is currently hitting is affecting the whole organization, so rather than pointing the finger at other issues (though they may be also very real), your best step forward as a team will be to hear from each other what personal action each individual should take after discussing this report.

1	HIGH	Your score includes multiple “high” areas of organizational health with no “low” ones. In one regard, this should be celebrated! If this truly reflects the reality of your leadership team, this score represents effort being put forward and a level of resilience that has been achieved! \r\n\r\nBut this report will be incredibly valuable for your leadership team. \r\n\r\nFirstly, recognizing that this assessment is only gathering the perspective of the leadership team, there is a chance that the way you are collectively perceiving yourselves and your organization does not fully match up with reality—the higher in leadership people go, the harder it is to receive true feedback (and the blinder we become to our blind spots). \r\n\r\nThe other potential is that there is false harmony within the team affecting each individual’s ratings. One of the skills a healthy leadership team must intentionally cultivate is one of confronting and considering difficult or offensive feedback rather than jumping to the reasons that would seem to explain it away. \r\n\r\nAs you proceed through this report, pause on the pieces that were not rated as highly, and note when the trust or candour diminishes in discussion."
2	MEDIUM	Your cumulative score puts most or all areas of organizational health in the middling zone. While this may not seem very helpful, it has actually provided some essential insight into your leadership team. \r\n\r\nThis is almost always the result of the respondents not being able to see their own situation clearly—it’s hard to definitely rate things as being incredibly positive, but you also don’t think there are many emergency concerns… These are the murky waters of a team in which there absolutely are real concerns, but they are buried under false harmony, miscommunication, and blind spots.\r\n\r\nThe other important note to make as you proceed through this report is that when a team believes they are “doing just fine”, there is no urgency for growth, and change will not happen. You took the time to take this assessment together. Don’t get in your own way with this next step. We provide everything possible to guide you towards critical discussion points and committing to action here, but you will need to rally yourselves to engage fully. You have the opportunity to break through invisible ceilings into far greater success, take it or leave it.
3	LOW	Your score includes multiple “low” areas of organizational health with no “high” ones. \r\n\r\nWhile it may surprise you, congratulations are in order. This means that at least most of your team is accepting the reality of your level of organizational health. While you may be facing a crisis and feeling the painful effects of low organizational health, this is the best place your team can be in to create real change. The rest of this report will help you clearly pinpoint and discuss the issues at hand and create practical action plans to roll out. \r\n\r\nNot all of your leadership team will have rated every area as low as others. This will be very important to approach tactfully. Data shows us that it is often the senior staff person who rated things the highest. But the value of discussing this report as a leadership team is that even if not everyone is seeing the issues at hand, the results are already in. \r\n\r\nThere are things that need to be addressed, so we would ask you to challenge yourself to listen without jumping to conclusions and remember that you may be influenced by personal blind spots, and this discussion may be instrumental in gaining insight that is critical to your continued leadership.
