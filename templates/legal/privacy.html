    <li><strong>Payment information:</strong> processed securely by Stripe. We do not store full card numbers or billing information.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical information:</strong> IP address, device/browser type, and basic diagnostics for security and performance.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use your information to:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Provide and operate the Ascent Assessment platform.</li>
    <li>Send transactional emails (e.g., invitations, password resets, assessment updates).</li>

    <li>Secure our services and comply with legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your data. We may share information with trusted service providers who help us deliver the service (e.g., Render for hosting, Mailgun for email, Stripe for payments). These providers process data on our behalf under appropriate safeguards. We may also share information if required by law.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain account data while your account is active. Assessment data (including participant responses and reports) remains until you delete your account or specific data. When data is deleted, it is removed from active systems but may remain in secure backups for a limited period.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location (e.g., Canada, EU/UK, certain US states), you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your data, and to lodge a complaint with a regulator.</p>
    <p>You can exercise these rights by contacting us at: <a href="mailto:privacy@orghealthteam.com">privacy@orghealthteam.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>6. International Users</h2>
    <p>Our services are hosted in the United States and/or Canada. If you use our services from outside these regions, you consent to the transfer and processing of your data internationally.</p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>We use industry-standard safeguards including encrypted connections, password hashing, and secure hosting. No method of transmission is 100% secure, but we work to protect your information.</p>

    <h2>8. Children</h2>
    <p>Our services are not directed to children under 16 and we do not knowingly collect their data.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to this Policy</h2>
