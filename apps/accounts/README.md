# Accounts App

The Teams app plays closely with Accounts, so here are the specifics for Accounts. 

The primary responsibilities here are:
- Registration (signup)
- Login/logout
- Password reset (eventually)

Future: user settings, email notifications, etc.

Accounts uses Django's built-in User model for now.
